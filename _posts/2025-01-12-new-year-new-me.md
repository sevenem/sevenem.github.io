**idea**

I love watching Dota 2 professional games and I hate spoilers. Unfortunately, [eventvods](www.eventvods.com) stopped covering Dota 2 two years ago.

**enter Tournatube**

Tournatube is both a professional and self-serving endeavour to provide me with a platform to watch Dota 2 professional games spoiler free.

**roadmap**

1. Plan layout of site
2. Figure out how to create each part
3. Implement each part of the site
4. Publish for others to test

**unrelated things**

Today I discovered github.dev as a way to quickly edit my blog in browser. Simply change the .com on the github site to .dev and you should get a VSCode like editor in browser (that doesn't seem to work on android for some reason). Pretty swish.

**new year new me**

Like the title says, new year new me. Going to try and stick to my interests and keep learning IT stuff, playing vidya, learning Japanese, playing piano and keeping fit.
